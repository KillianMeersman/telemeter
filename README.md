# Telenet Telemeter parser
# Removed on request by Telenet.

## Explanation
Telenet has requested that I remove this code from GitHub.
Apparently some people are using it to continously poll their data (every .5 seconds even).
This is obviously **not** how you're supposed to use any API and is creating unnecessary load on their infrastructure. I want to ask people to use common sense and etiquette when using external resources.

As I had already lost interest in the maintenance of this package, I am not going to fight to keep it online. There are forks that may still have active maintainers, I encourage them to build in some kind of rate limiting and support for HTTP code 429.
